```{toctree}
:hidden:

../build/autodoc2/trilium_alchemy/trilium_alchemy
```

This package provides:
- A high level interface to interact with Trilium
- Programmatic access to tooling for extensions and synchronization

Auto-generated code documentation is enabled by the [autodoc2](https://sphinx-autodoc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Sphinx extension, a new and innovative documentation generator.

Custom templating and Sphinx doctree handling were developed to produce this API documentation. These will eventually be spun off into a separate project for reuse.
