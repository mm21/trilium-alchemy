# Installation

It's recommended to create an isolated environment via [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) so as to more closely track the TriliumAlchemy version installed. This will enable you to upgrade TriliumAlchemy and make any required API changes at your convenience.

## PyPI

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install trilium-alchemy
```
